# Web-Design-Challenge
For this homework we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data.
In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

##Websites to include:
- Data.html
- Cloudiness.html
- Windspeed.html
- Temperature.html
- Humidity.html
- Comparison.html
- Index.html
- style.css
## In addition, Resources folder contains referencing images for building up website and csv file for data.html
